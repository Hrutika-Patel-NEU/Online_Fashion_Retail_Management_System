# Online Fashion Retail Management System

## üìå Overview

This project presents a comprehensive and normalized **Online Fashion Retail Management System** designed to solve key challenges in modern online shopping platforms. It focuses on optimizing product discovery, dynamic pricing, inventory tracking, secure transactions, and flexible user experiences with efficient address and order management.

---

## üö© Problem Statement

Modern e-commerce platforms often suffer from:

- ‚ùå Inefficient product filtering based on user-centric attributes.
- ‚ùå Lack of real-time inventory and pricing logic.
- ‚ùå Poor order management that cannot handle multiple items per order.
- ‚ùå Inflexible address storage limited to user profiles.
- ‚ùå Scattered and redundant product attribute data.
- ‚ùå Weak access control and role-based security.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Highlights

### üîç Improved Product Discovery
- Filter products by `Fit`, `Length`, `Neckline`, `Sleeve Type`, etc.
- Category-specific filters (e.g., "Wide Leg" for Pants, "Mini" for Dresses).

### üí∏ Dynamic Pricing & Inventory Management
- `IsAvailable`: Prevents showing out-of-stock items.
- `IsArchived`: Hides discontinued products.

### üì¶ Accurate Order Processing
- Orders include line items to track **quantity** and **price** per product.
- Supports pricing at the **moment of order placement**.

### üì¨ Flexible Address Management
- Users can store **multiple addresses**.
- At checkout, choose between saved addresses (e.g., NYC Home or LA Office).

### üß± Optimized Data Model
- Attributes (Fit, Material, Sleeve Type) are normalized for:
  - üîÅ Reuse across products.
  - ‚ö° Fast search and filtering.

### üîê Role-Based Access Control
- `Admin`: Full access to manage products, users, orders, and inventory.
- `Standard User`: Place orders, manage addresses, submit reviews, and maintain cart.
- `Business Analytics User`: Access views and reports for insights and performance tracking.
- `Guest User`: Limited browsing access to public product and category data.

---

## üìã Business Rules

### üë• User & Role Rules
- `Email`, `First Name`, `Last Name`, and `Phone Number` are mandatory for user registration.
- Email and Phone Number must be **unique** and follow valid formats.
- User Role must be one of the following:
   - `Admin`: Full system management.
   - `Standard User`: Can place orders, manage cart, addresses, reviews
   - `Business Analytics User`: Read-only access to data and reports.
   - `Guest User`: Limited access, browsing only.
- A user cannot register multiple times with the same email or phone number.
- Each user is assigned a **Tier**: `Standard`, `Bronze`, `Silver`, `Gold`, or `Platinum`.

### üè∑Ô∏è Product & Category Rules
- Each product must belong to a valid **Category** and **Brand** (enforced via foreign keys).
- Product name must be **non-empty** and **unique within its brand**.
- Products marked as `IsArchived = 'Y'` or `IsAvailable = 'N'` are excluded from storefront, cart, and checkout.
- Out-of-stock products **cannot** be added to the cart or ordered.

### üé® Product Variations, Attributes & Images
- Stock quantity for all product variations must be `‚â• 0`.
- Each product variation must be **uniquely identified** by `Product`, `Size`, and `Color`.
- At least **one image** is required per variation before it can be made publicly visible.

- A user cannot have **duplicate cart entries** for the same product variation.
- Only **active and in-stock products** can be added to the cart.
- Cart is **automatically cleared** after order placement (handled at the application layer).

### üì¶ Order Rules
- Order line items must have quantity `‚â• 1`.
- Discounts are applied at checkout using the formula:  
   `SellingPrice = Price - (Price * UserTier.DiscountRate / 100)`
- A user‚Äôs discount eligibility is dynamically determined based on their assigned `UserTier`.

### üí≥ Payment Rules
- All orders must have a valid **payment method** and **payment status** recorded.

### ‚≠ê Review Rules
