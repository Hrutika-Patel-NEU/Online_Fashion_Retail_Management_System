## 📌 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive and normalized **Online Fashion Retail Management System** designed to solve key challenges in modern online shopping platforms. It focuses on optimizing product discovery, dynamic pricing, inventory tracking, secure transactions, and flexible user experiences with efficient address and order management.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Modern e-commerce platforms often suffer from:

- ❌ Inefficient product filtering based on user-centric attributes.
- ❌ Lack of real-time inventory and pricing logic.
- ❌ Poor order management that cannot handle multiple items per order.
- ❌ Inflexible address storage limited to user profiles.
- ❌ Scattered and redundant product attribute data.
- ❌ Weak access control and role-based security.

---

## ✅ Solution Highlights

### 🔍 Improved Product Discovery
- Filter products by `Fit`, `Length`, `Neckline`, `Sleeve Type`, etc.
- Category-specific filters (e.g., "Wide Leg" for Pants, "Mini" for Dresses).

### 💸 Dynamic Pricing & Inventory Management
- `IsAvailable`: Prevents showing out-of-stock items.
- `IsArchived`: Hides discontinued products.

### 📦 Accurate Order Processing
- Orders include line items to track **quantity** and **price** per product.
- Supports pricing at the **moment of order placement**.

### 📬 Flexible Address Management
- Users can store **multiple addresses**.
- At checkout, choose between saved addresses (e.g., NYC Home or LA Office).

### 🧱 Optimized Data Model
- Attributes (Fit, Material, Sleeve Type) are normalized for:
  - 🔁 Reuse across products.
  - ⚡ Fast search and filtering.

### 🔐 Role-Based Access Control
- `Admin`: Manage products, orders, and inventory.
- `Customer`: Place orders, manage addresses, submit reviews.
